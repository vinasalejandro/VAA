-- TRANSPARENT DATA ENCRYPTION (TDE)

-- AT REST
-- mdf, ndf, ldf

--Configuring a SQL Server database for TDE is a straight-forward process. It consists of:

--Creating the database master key in the master database.
--Creating a certificate encrypted by that key.
--Backing up the certificate and the certificate's private key. While this isn't required to encrypt the database, you want to do this immediately.
--Creating a database encryption key in the database that's encrypted by the certificate.
--Altering the database to turn encryption on.

USE [master];
GO 

-- Create the database master key
-- to encrypt the certificate
CREATE MASTER KEY
  ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'abc123.';
GO 

-- Create the certificate we're going to use for TDE
CREATE CERTIFICATE TDECertVAA
  WITH SUBJECT = 'TDE Cert for Test';
GO

--Even on databases that are basically empty, it does take a few seconds to encrypt the database.

--encryption_state	int	Indicates whether the database is encrypted or not encrypted.

--0 = No database encryption key present, no encryption

--1 = Unencrypted

--2 = Encryption in progress

--3 = Encrypted

--4 = Key change in progress

--5 = Decryption in progress

--6 = Protection change in progress (The certificate or asymmetric key that is encrypting the database encryption key is being changed.)

-- As the comments indicate, we're looking for our database to show a state of 3, meaning the encryption is finished. 

-- When the encryption_state shows as 3, you should take a backup of the database, because we'll need it for the restore to the second server (your path may vary):

-- Now backup the database so we can restore it
-- Onto a second server

-- Now that we have the backup, let's restore this backup to a different instance of SQL Server.

-- Failed Restore - No Key, No Certificate

-- The first scenario for restoring a TDE protected database is the case where we try 
-- to do the restore and we have none of the encryption pieces in place. 
-- We don't have the database master key and we certainly don't have the certificate. 
-- This is why TDE is great. If you don't have these pieces, the restore simply 
-- won't work. Let's attempt the restore (note: your paths may be different):









--intento sin certificado

RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDEVAA]
  FROM DISK = 'C:\BD\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO 'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO 'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer_log.mdf';
GO

--Msg 33111, Level 16, State 3, Line 130
--Cannot find server certificate with thumbprint '0x192834B1A8B932393B9101D24B8F759A49BB1397'.
--Msg 3013, Level 16, State 1, Line 130
--RESTORE DATABASE is terminating abnormally.

-- This will fail. Here's what you should see if you attempt the restore:

-- When SQL Server attempts the restore, it recognizes it needs a certificate, a specific certificate at that. Since the certificate isn't present, the restore fails.



-- Failed Restore - The Same Certificate Name, But Not the Same Certificate

-- The second scenario is where the database master key is present and there's a certificate with the same name as the first server (even the same subject), but it wasn't the certificate from the first server. Let's set that up and attempt the restore:

-- Let's create the database master key and a certificate with the same name
-- But not from the files. Note the difference in passwords
CREATE MASTER KEY
  ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'SecondServerPassw0rd!';
GO 

-- Though this certificate has the same name, the restore won't work
CREATE CERTIFICATE TDECert
  WITH SUBJECT = 'TDE Cert for Test';
GO 

-- Since we don't have the corrected certificate, this will fail, too.
RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDE]
  FROM DISK = N'C:\BD\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer_log.mdf';
GO

--Msg 3013, Level 16, State 1, Line 163
--RESTORE DATABASE is terminating abnormally.

-- Note the difference in the password for the database master key. It's different, but that's not the reason we'll fail with respect to the restore. It's the same problem as the previous case: we don't have the correct certificate. As a result, you'll get the same error as in the previous case.



----------

-- The Successful Restore

-- In order to perform a successful restore, we'll need the database master key in the master database in place and we'll need to restore the certificate used to encrypt the database, but we'll need to make sure we restore it with the private key. In checklist form:

--There's a database master key in the master database.
--The certificate used to encrypt the database is restored along with its private key.
--The database is restored.
--Since we have the database master key, let's do the final two steps. Of course, since we have to clean up the previous certificate, we'll have a drop certificate in the commands we issue:

-- Let's do this one more time. This time, with everything,
-- Including the private key.
DROP CERTIFICATE TDECert;
GO 

-- Restoring the certificate, but without the private key.
CREATE CERTIFICATE TDECert
  FROM FILE = 'C:\SQLBackups\TDECert.cer'
  WITH PRIVATE KEY ( 
    FILE = N'C:\SQLBackups\TDECert_key.pvk',
 DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'APrivateKeyP4ssw0rd!'
  );
GO

-- We have the correct certificate and we've also restored the 
-- private key. Now everything should work. Finally!
RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDE]
  FROM DISK = N'C:\SQLBackups\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO N'C:\SQLData\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO N'C:\SQLData\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer_log.mdf';
GO

-- With everything in place, we are finally successful!
