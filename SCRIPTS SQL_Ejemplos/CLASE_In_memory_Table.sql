-- Table properties show Memory Optimized = TRUE and Durability = SchemaAndData once the table is created which makes it very simple to verify what the table is doing.


--Inserting and selecting against the table is syntactically the same as any other regular table, however, internally it is far different. Above and beyond the table creation, its structured behavior is basically the same in these actions including adding or removing a column.  Now one caveat to these tables is that you cannot CREATE or DROP an Index the same way. You must use ADD/DROP Index to accomplish this, and, believe me, I tried. Indexing these tables is covered later in the article.

--Remember the DURABILITY option I briefly mentioned before? This is important. The example above has it set to SCHEMA_AND_DATA which means, upon database going offline, both the schema and data are preserved on disk. If you choose SCHEMA_ONLY, this means that only the structure will be preserved, and data will be deleted. This is very important to note as it can introduce data loss when used incorrectly.

--As you can see, In-Memory tables are not as complicated as my brain wanted to make them. It’s a relatively simple concept that just incorporates row versioning and two copies of the table. Once you pull the concept apart into its parts, it really makes it easier to understand.

--Which Tables Do I Put In-Memory?
--Determining which tables could benefit from being In-Memory is made easy by using a tool called Memory Optimization Advisor (MOA). This a is a tool built into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) that will inform you of which tables could benefit using In-Memory OLTP capabilities, and which may have non supported features. Once identified, MOA will help you to migrate that table and data to be optimized.

--To see how it works, I’ll walk you through using it on a table I use for demonstrations in AdventureWorks2016CTP3. Since this is a smaller table and doesn’t incur a ton writes it is not a good use case, however, for simplicity I am using it for this demo.

--To get started, right-click on the Sales.OrderTracking table and select Memory Optimization Advisor.
