-- Configuring Always Encrypted Using SSMS
-------------------------------

-- Security is one of the most important requirements for a data-driven system. 
-- Encryption is one of the ways to secure the data. Wikipedia defines encryption as:

-- “Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only 
-- authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.”

-- In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft introduced an encryption feature called Always Encrypted. 
-- We will see what Always Encrypted is, and how it can be used to 
-- encrypt and decrypt data, with the help of simple examples.


-- What is SQL Server Always Encrypted?

-- Always Encrypted is a security feature that allows the client application to manage 
-- the encryption and decryption keys, 
-- thus ensuring that only the client application can decrypt and use sensitive data.

-- Several encryption techniques exist, however they are not as secure as Always Encrypted. 
-- For instance, symmetric key encryption is used to encrypt data on the database side. 
-- A drawback of this approach is that if any other database administrator has the decryption key, 
-- he can access the data.

-- On the other hand, in case of Always Encrypted, the data is encrypted on the client side
-- and the database server 
-- receives a ciphered version of the data. 
-- Hence, the data cannot be deciphered at the database end. 
-- Only the client that encrypted the data can decrypt it.

--Key Types

--SQL Server Always Encrypted feature uses two types of keys:

--Column Encryption Key (CEK)

--It is always placed on the database server. 
--The data is actually encrypted using column CEK. 
-- However, if someone on the database side has access to CEK, 
-- he can decrypt the data.

-- Column Master Key (CMK)

--This key is placed on the client side or any third party storage. 
-- CMK is used to protect the CEK, adding an additional layer of security. 
-- Whoever has access to CMK can actually decrypt the CEK which can then be used 
-- to decipher the actual data.

-- Encryption Types

-- Deterministic

-- This type of encryption will always generate similar encrypted text for the same type 
-- of data. 
-- If you want to implement searching and grouping on a table column, use deterministic encryption for that column.

-- Randomized

-- Randomized Encryption will generate different encrypted text for the same type of data, 
-- whenever you try to encrypt the data.
-- Use randomized encryption if the column is not used for grouping and searching.

-- Let’s now configure SSMS for to enable Always Encrypted. 
-- As we said earlier, Always Encrypted creates column encryption keys and 
-- column master keys.

-- PASO 1  
-- Ver SECURITY -> ALWAYS ENCRYPTED KEYS          EMPTY

-- To see the existing column encryption keys and column master keys, 
-- for the 
-- School Database, go to Databases -> School -> Security -> Always Encrypted Keys 

-- Since you don’t have any encrypted record in the dataset, 
-- you won’t see any CEK or CMK in the list.

-- VACIAS

-- COLUMN MASTER KEYS
-- COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEYS

--

-- Let’s now enable encryption on the Password and SSN columns of the Student table. 

-- PASO 2
-- To do so, Right Click on Databases -> School. 
-- From the dropdown menu, select 
				-- Encrypt Columns 
-- APARECE WIZARD

-- Click Next button on the Introduction window. 

-- From the Column Selection window, check Password and SSN columns.

-- For the Password column, select the encryption type as		Randomized. 

-- For      SSN column, choose	Deterministic.

-- Password	SSN ENCRIPTADOS


--Retrieving Decrypted Data

--The SELECT query returned encrypted data. 


--What if you want to retrieve data in decrypted form? 


-- PASO 3

-- To do so create a New Query Window in SSMS 
-- and then click the Change Connection icon 
-- at the top of Object Explorer 

-- From the window that appears, click on 

--			Additional Connection Parameters tab 

-- from the top left and enter

--			“Column Encryption Setting = Enabled” 

-- in the text box as shown in the following screenshot. 

-- Finally, click the Connect button.

-- Column Encryption Setting = Enabled
